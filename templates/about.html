                the world we live in. In this current state of the world, new technologies are being developed to try to 
                mitigate our damaging affects on climate change. Our helpful tool we developed allows the user to visualize the data 
                of their own carbon footprint depending on how they change their behavior. With simple graphs that are easy 
                to read, our program will help you make your choice towards a better future.
